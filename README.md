🌟 **Welcome to Data-Augmentation-and-Classification-of-FruitNet!** 🍎🍌🍊

In today's tech-driven world, the Human Interaction Machine signifies a leap into the digital age. This innovation mimics human cognition, driving industries towards Industry 4.0. Intelligent systems revolutionize business and production, ensuring flawless performance across diverse domains.

🎯 **Project Aim:**
Develop a robust classification algorithm for fruit data, facilitating accurate categorization based on quality parameters. This algorithm discerns fruit quality, aiding categorization efforts, and enhancing decision-making processes.

📚 **Dataset:**
We utilize the FruitNet dataset, comprising a wide range of Indian fruit images with labels. Its varied categories and quality parameters make it ideal for real-time fruit classification tasks.

📊 **Dataset Imbalance:**
Notably, some fruit categories suffer from significant imbalance, with varying numbers of images per category. This imbalance poses challenges but doesn't necessarily impede model training and performance.

🧠 **Models Considered:**
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Simple structure with three convolution and max-pooling layers, connected to fully connected layers.
2. **ResNet50:** Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with custom fully connected layers.
3. **EfficientNet B5:** Pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuned with custom fully connected layers.

🔍 **Comparison and Transfer Learning:**
We compare the performance of these models on the FruitNet dataset. Transfer learning with pretrained models significantly boosts performance.

📈 **Knowledge Distillation (KD):**
Implementing KD, we use the best-fitting model as the teacher and the worst-performing model as the student. This process enhances the student's efficiency by approximately 20%, making it suitable for edge devices with limited computational resources.

🚀 **Conclusion:**
Data augmentation and classification of FruitNet offer promising insights into fruit quality assessment and categorization. By leveraging advanced techniques like transfer learning and knowledge distillation, we strive towards efficient and accurate fruit classification systems.
